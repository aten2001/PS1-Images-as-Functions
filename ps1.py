        Note: Where 'middle' is ambiguous because of any difference in the oddness
        or evenness of the size of the copied region and the image size, the function
        rounds downwards.  E.g. in copying a shape = (1,1) from a src image of size (2,2)
        into an dst image of size (3,3), the function copies the range [0:1,0:1] of 
        the src into the range [1:2,1:2] of the dst.
