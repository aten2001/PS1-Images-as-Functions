#Problem Set 1: Images as Functions (really, arrays or matrices of numbers)

##Description
The purpose of this problem set is to make sure you can have setup your development environment and can load an image, manipulate the values, produce some output, and submit the code along with the report.

##Setup
If you have not already done so, please follow the instructions in the file `Installation.md` to setup your development environment.

In addition to script files provided in this repository, you will need to import some dependencies from another git repository.  Running

<pre>
	<code>
		git submodule init
		git submodule update
	</code>
</pre>

should do the trick.

##Instructions
First, follow the installation guide in the [Installation.md](https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps01/blob/master/Installation.md) file.  If you have questions, please post them to Piazza.
